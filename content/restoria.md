Restoria is an ecology-themed board game designed by my husband and me, inspired by my research and his love for games. With a focus on California flora, its gameplay is built around the four key ecological processes of community assembly: selection, drift, dispersal, and speciation. 

Each player chooses and arranges different species of plants to build a thriving community. Throughout the game, events like drought, invasive species, or wildfire will occur, which will affect each community based on its composition. The player whose community has the highest biomass at the end of the game, wins!

### Our Story ###
My husband, Brent Batas, and I are the creators of Restoria. Brent is a game designer by trade, and he and I love playing board games with our friends. When the pandemic hit in 2020, I started water painting my favorite plants in my free time. Brent had a brilliant idea to use those art to make our own card game. We collaborated on the game play and design over several months to assure that the game is not only fun but scientifically accurate (as much as possible). In the end, we wanted to make a game that we would enjoy playing. We also wanted to make it portable, so we can bring it to fieldwork or camping trips. 

### Status ###
The game is coming soon. We test-played with our friends and iteratively made several prototypes of this game in 2021. We are currently in the process of finding a publisher to officially get this game off the ground. Stay tuned to get your copy!
