### Effect of Post-fire Restoration on Plant Genetic Diversity

Native plant seeding after wildfires is a common restoration practice throughout the Great Basin. Native perennial grass species are often included in the seed mix to prevent soil erosion and provide forage. What are the effects of seeding and landscape-dispersal on the genetic diversity of restored and neighboring native grass populations? I am exploring this question by genotyping bluebunch wheatgrass in an area affected by Soda Fire that burned in 2015.

### Seed Provenance in Post-fire Restoration

The seed provenance, or the geographic origin of a seed source, is an important decision in restoration. The common strategy is to use local seeds, based on the argument that local plants are best adapted to their environment. However, the impacts of annual grass invasion and climate change on plant populations begs the question, will the plants we plant now persist into the future? Seed sourcing that considers anticipated future environmental conditions of a restoration site may improve restoration success. To test this, I am conducting a field experiment at the Northern Great Basin Experimental Range in Harney County, Oregon.

### Bridging Species Coexistence and Restoration

How do you know when restoration is successful? Restoration assessment is non-trivial when the target population fluctuates and the starting condition changes over time. At the same time, Modern Coexistence Theory, has highlighted that fluctuating environment and species interactions can maintain species populations. I am part of an iDiv working group led by Dr. Lauren Shoemaker, Dr. Lauren Hallett, and Dr. Akasha Faist that is bridging the gap between restoration and Modern Coexistence Theory. Using a long-term data of an endangered plant species (Lasthenia conjugens) from a vernal pool restoration project, we investigated how principles from Modern Coexistence Theory could be applied to diagnose restoration trajectories. 

### Ecological Site Description and Ecosystem Services

Rangelands provide numerous ecosystem services. The Ecological Site Description framework developed to primarily manage forage on heterogeneous landscapes has potential to be used to manage other range resources such as biodiversity and soil carbon. I explored this potential at Tejon Ranch in southern California. 

### Rangeland Conservation

California range is a patchwork of private and public lands. Conservation in this context hinges on partnerships across multiple stakeholders. I interviewed ranchers, land managers, and academics across California to understand their perception of rangeland conservation and barriers and opportunities for working together.
