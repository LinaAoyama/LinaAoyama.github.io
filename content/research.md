### Plant Genetic Diversity and Post-fire Restoration

Native plant seeding after wildfires is a common restoration practice throughout the Great Basin. Native perennial grass species are often included in the seed mix to prevent soil erosion and provide forage. What are the effects of seeding and landscape-dispersal on the genetic diversity of restored and neighboring native grass populations? I am exploring this question by genotyping bluebunch wheatgrass in an area affected by Soda Fire that burned in 2015.

### Bridging Species Coexistence and Restoration

How do you know when restoration is successful? Restoration assessment is non-trivial when the target population and the environment fluctuates over time. A prominent community ecology theory, Modern Coexistence Theory, mathematically describes the mechanisms behind species coexistence in fluctuating environment and species interactions. I am part of an iDiv working group led by Dr. Lauren Shoemaker, Dr. Lauren Hallett, and Dr. Akasha Faist that is bridging the gap between restoration and Modern Coexistence Theory. Using a long-term data of an endangered plant species (Lasthenia conjugens) from a vernal pool restoration project, we investigated how demographic modeling coupled with principles from Modern Coexistence Theory offers a powerful way to diagnose restoration trajectories. 

### Ecological Site Description

Rangelands provide numerous ecosystem services. The Ecological Site Description framework developed to primarily manage forage on heterogeneous landscapes has potential to be used to manage other range resources such as biodiversity and soil carbon. I explored this potential at Tejon Ranch in southern California. 

### Rangeland Conservation

California range is a patchwork of private and public lands. Conservation in this context hinges on partnerships across multiple stakeholders. What are the barriers and opportunities for rangeland conservation? I interviewed ranchers, land managers, and academics across California to understand their common ground.
