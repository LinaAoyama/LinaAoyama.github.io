Effect of Post-fire Restoration on Plant Genetic Diversity
</h3>
Native plant seeding after wildfires is a common restoration practice throughout the Great Basin. Native perennial grass species are often included in the seed mix to prevent soil erosion and provide forage. What are the effects of seeding and landscape-dispersal on the genetic diversity of restored and neighboring native grass populations? I am exploring this question by genotyping bluebunch wheatgrass in an area affected by Soda Fire that burned in 2015.

The seed provenance, or the geographic origin of a seed source, is an important decision in restoration. The common strategy is to use local seeds, based on the argument that local plants are best adapted to their environment. However, the impacts of annual grass invasion and climate change on plant populations begs the question, will the plants we plant now persist into the future? Seed sourcing that considers anticipated future environmental conditions of a restoration site may improve restoration success. To test this, I am conducting a common garden experiment on a native grass species, bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides).

Application of Modern Coexistence Theory
</h3>
How do you know when restoration is successful? Restoration assessment is non-trivial when the target population fluctuates and the starting condition changes over time. At the same time, Modern Coexistence Theory has highlighted that fluctuating environment and species interactions can maintain species coexistence. I am part of an iDiv working group that is bridging the gap between restoration and Modern Coexistence Theory. Using a long-term data set of an endangered species, Contra Costa goldfields (*Lasthenia conjugens*) from a vernal pool restoration project in California, we investigated how principles from Modern Coexistence Theory could be applied to diagnose restoration trajectories.

Rangelands provide numerous ecosystem services such as forage, biodiversity, and soil carbon. The Ecological Site Description framework developed to primarily manage forage on heterogeneous landscapes has potential to be used to manage other range resources. I explored this potential for application at Tejon Ranch in Kern County, California.

California range is a patchwork of private and public lands. Conservation in this context hinges on partnerships across multiple stakeholders. I interviewed ranchers, land managers, and academics across California to understand their perception of rangeland conservation, and barriers and opportunities for working together.
