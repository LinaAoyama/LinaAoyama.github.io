I am an interdisciplinary ecologist interested in improving the management and restoration of rangelands in the Western U.S. in the face of increasing threats from climate change, wildfire, and invasive species. My research draws on concepts from population and community ecology to understand how environmental variability, species interactions, and management practices influence plant communities. I use a wide array of inferences from field surveys, common garden experiments, long-term observations, and models to understand plant responses to these complex interactions.

Currently, I am a USDA NIFA Predoctoral Fellow and a PhD candidate in [Dr. Lauren Hallett's lab](https://hallettlab.netlify.app/) at the University of Oregon. For my doctorate, I am exploring 1) the forward-looking seed sourcing strategies for post-fire restoration in the Great Basin; 2) the role of genetic and functional diversity in resilience of plant communities; and 3) the practical application of modern coexistence theory to plant restoration. 

I completed my MS in Rangeland Management at UC Berkeley working with [Dr. James Bartolome](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/james-bartolome). I studied 1) the application of Ecological Site Description to assess ecosystem services at a ranch-level; and 2) the perceived barriers and opportunities for implementing conservation practices on California rangelands.
