I am a range ecologist broadly interested in how environmental variability, species interactions, and management influence rangeland resources such as plant communities and soil carbon. Much of my work is in arid and semiarid ecosystems, but I also rely on statistical and simulation modeling techniques that apply to many ecosystems. 

Currently, I am a USDA NIFA Predoctoral Fellow and a PhD candidate in [Dr. Lauren Hallett's lab](https://hallettlab.netlify.app/) at the University of Oregon. For my doctorate, I am exploring how rainfall variability and invasive annual grasses affect native grass germination and persistence. This project aims to improve post-fire restoration in the Great Basin. 

I completed my MS in Rangeland Management at UC Berkeley in the guidance of [Dr. James Bartolome](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/james-bartolome). I studied the potential of assessing plant biodiversity and soil carbon at the ranch scale using the Ecological Site Description framework.

I am grateful for all my mentors who have unleashed my passion for ecology. To pay it forward, I involve undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds in my fieldwork and lab work. I also started the student chapter of [Society of Ecological Restoration at the University of Oregon](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/uoser/) to create a community of students who are excited to learn about restoration and take action in our local parks.
