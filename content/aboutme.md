I am a range ecologist interested in improving the conservation and restoration of rangelands in the Western U.S. I draw on concepts from population ecology, community ecology, and landscape genetics to understand how environmental variability, species interactions, and management influence plant communities. I work on semi-arid rangeland ecosystems where climate change, wildfire, and invasive species are rapidly changing the biodiveristy, ecosystem services, and natural resources that people depend on. 

Currently, I am a USDA NIFA Predoctoral Fellow and a PhD candidate in [Dr. Lauren Hallett's lab](https://hallettlab.netlify.app/) at the University of Oregon. For my doctorate, I am exploring how climate-adjusted seed sourcing and seedling trait screening improve post-fire restoration in the Great Basin. 

I completed my MS in Rangeland Management at UC Berkeley working with [Dr. James Bartolome](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/james-bartolome). I studied the potential application of the Ecological Site Description framework for assessing plant biodiversity and soil carbon at the ranch scale.

I find great joy when I am doing collaborative science. I am lucky to have mentors and colleagues who inspire, encourage, and challenge me to do my best work. As much as I can, I take undergraduate students to my field sites because that is how I got interested in science. I also started a student chapter of [Society of Ecological Restoration at the University of Oregon](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/uoser/) to create hands-on experiences of ecological restoration for students on campus and local city parks.
