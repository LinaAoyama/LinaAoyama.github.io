The paper I wrote with the sToration working group is out! "Application of modern coexistence theory to rare plant restoration provides early indication of restoration trajectories" can be accessed here:
[https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2649](https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2649).

It's the first empirical paper that attempts to bridge modern coexistence theory and ecological restoration. We focus on the restoration effort of the endangered Contra Costa goldfields (*Lasthenia conjugens*) in California vernal pools for this study. We find that the tools developed for modern coexistence theory can be used to determine long-term re-establishment success, and what factors contribute to restoration success or failure.
