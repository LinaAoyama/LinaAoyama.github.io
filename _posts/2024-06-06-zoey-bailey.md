Congratulations to Zoey Bailey for graduating the University of Oregon with honors! Zoey and I met at a volunteer event transplanting wild strawberries at the native plant nursery in Eugene. She is a highly motivated, budding fire ecologist. She spent her summers fire fighting and doing research in our lab. For her honors thesis, she studied the effects of fire on above and belowground plant communities - people usually ignore the seedbank - at the Northern Great Basin Experimental Range. I have learned so much from her. Keep pursing what is interesting to you!
