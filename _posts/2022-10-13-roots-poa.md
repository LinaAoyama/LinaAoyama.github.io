Our new article, "Intraspecific variation in native grass seedling plastic trait response to water stress depends on the context of annual grass invasion" is published in Restoration Ecology! My undergraduate mentee, Emily Cook and I spent a lot of time in the greenhouse sifting through roots and leaves of Sanberg bluegrass (*Poa secunda*) to find out how seedling traits shift in response to water stress and cheatgrass (invasive annual grass) competition. We found that *P. secunda* seedlings exhibit more resource-conservative traits under drought, especially high proportion of fine roots, but shift towards more resource-acquisitive traits in presence of cheatgrass.
