Our new article, "Functional diversity buffers biomass production across variable rainfall conditions through different processes above- versus below-ground" published in Functional Ecology has been long time coming! Ashley Shaw and I started analyzing this data back in 2019 but it was missing some data. We put a pin on it and collected more trait data in 2021 to complete the dataset. This effort was worthwhile because it revealed that functional diversity enables species shuffling, which is an important mechanism for buffering biomass production during seasonal drought.
