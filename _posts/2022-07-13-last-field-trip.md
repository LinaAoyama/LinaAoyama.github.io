Cheatgrass (*Bromus tectorum*) and the second-year squirreltail stands (*Elymus elymoides*) were producing seeds. I collected their height, leaf traits, and biomass.

That's a wrap! I cannot believe this is the last data collection trip for my dissertation. I have made this trip between Eugene and Burns at least twenty times in the last four years. Some trips felt lonely because I could not bring anyone with me during the peek of COVID-19, but other trips were rich and rewarding because of the people who came to help me in the field. 

Special thanks to the following: Alejandro Brambila, Zoey Bailey, Lydia Beebe, Maddy Case, Ori Chafe, Emily Cook, Lauren Hallett, Eliza Hernandez, Bryce Izlar, and Bronwyn Thomas.
