Big congratulations to Bronwyn Thomas for graduating the University of Oregon with B.S. Biology! Bronwyn's broad curiousity for plant ecology led them to our lab, and they helped us with various projects from germination trials to fieldwork in the Great Basin. They will be starting a new job at Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. Excited for your career in science!
