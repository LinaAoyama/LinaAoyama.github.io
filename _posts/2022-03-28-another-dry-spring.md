I visited my field site in Northern Great Basin Experimental Range last week. Snow had all melted and the temperature during the day reached around 70 degrees. I knew it was spring when I saw sagebrush buttercups (<em>Ranunculus glaberrimus<em>) flowering on the hills on my way to the field station. 

At my common garden experiment, I censused squirreltail (<em>Elymus elymoides<em>) and cheatgrass (<em>Bromus tectorum<em>) seedlings that I seeded last fall. Squirreltail seedlings were still very small and sparse (see pic), while cheatgass seedlings were taking off, growing thick and greenish red leaves. 

I found double or triple the number of squirreltail seedlings in my plots last year around the same time, so I am worried that it's another dry spring this year like in spring 2020. We'll have to wait and see!

One good thing coming out of this project is that I am getting a lot better at ID'ing grass seedlings!
